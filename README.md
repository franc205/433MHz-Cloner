# How to sniff?
1. Load the "receive.ino" file in arduino (remember to use RHSwitch.h and output file)
2. When a signal is transmited, you could see what it's says in serial monitor.

# How to Spoof?
1. Modify the "send.ino" and add the params that you get with the sniffer.
2. Load it in arduino.
3. Have fun :D
